# Hot Sauce Exercise

## Purpose
This exercise is provided as a less stressful and more realistic technical interview alternative to whiteboard exercises and real-time, recall-based coding challenges. We understand that you have other commitments and don't expect this to take more than a few hours to complete. It should be somewhat enjoyable, or at least more so than studying up on binary trees and sorting algorithms. It is not a test, but rather a starting point for discussion in the interview.

## Specification
You'll be building an application for browsing hot sauces. The first page is a grid of hot sauces, with an image, title, and subtitle for each. Upon clicking one of these, the user will be taken to a detail page, where a larger image and in-depth description of the sauce is provided. A link is provided to go back to the grid page to select another hot sauce. Each grid item also contains a small delete button in the corner, which will remove it from the grid. There's no need to update the data source.

Alongside these instructions you'll find two wireframes which correspond to these pages. The wireframes are intentionally rough and a starting point for the UX, so don't worry about matching the design pixel-for-pixel. Instead, we'd like you to improve on it. Consider which pieces of the app to improve: the hot sauce cards; the grid layout; the detail view; etc. Tempting as it might be to redesign everything, doing so can be quite time consuming and your time is valuable to us, so please don't feel pressured to do soâ€”notable visual improvements to one or two pieces will be sufficient.

Consider these visual design elements in your improvements: spacing; colors; element states (hover, click, focus, etc); typography/font choices (feel free to use resources like [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)); animation; etc. You may want to use a design tool like Figma or Adobe XD to quickly put ideas together, but this isn't a requirement.

A JSON file of hot sauces is provided to serve as a data source for your application. You may modify it if you wish.

## Questions
While on a real project you'd have access to designers and program managers to clarify the requirements, for this exercise you may have to make some assumptions. Feel free to reach out to the team at any time if you have questions of any kind. We're here to support you. Please note anything that was unclear so that we can improve this exercise in the future.

## Optional enhancements
Here are some ideas if you would like to go beyond the specification. We welcome any or all of these, but encourage you not to feel obligated to do them.

* Enhancing the functionality or behavior
* Add routing for sauce URLs
* Enable adding a sauce (title, description, image, etc.)
* Make the pages responsive
* Animations, transitions, etc.

## Requirements
Your web application must:
* Use [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* Improve the design of the app
* Use the provided JSON file as a data source
* Use custom-built and styled components
  * You may use libraries like Bootstrap or Fluent UI, but if you do, make sure you've noticeably updated the styling from the default
* Use a build system, such as [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (or whatever you prefer)

## Deliverables
Please send us instructions on how to set up up the project and a ZIP of all necessary files. For the interview call after completing this exercise, please have your app running on a device so we can review it together.
