# GETTIN' SAUCY

## Purpose

The _best_ application around for learning about and comparing hotsauce!

---

## How To

This app is not currently deployed and you will need to download the zip file or fork the repo to view on your localhost server.

You can view the repo on GitHub @ [malicemarie/hotsauce-exercise](https://github.com/malicemarie/hotsauce-exercise).

### Running Node.js and npm

Download [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) if you have not already.

To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:
`node -v`

To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:
`npm -v`

### Get the code

Visit my [Github](https://github.com/malicemarie/hotsauce-exercise) to download a zip file or clone.

**[Not sure how to clone?](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)**

### Start the Application

Once the code is in your editor of choice run `npm start` in your terminal at the root or public folder of the project.

## Technologies Used

I used create-react-app to load the application.

I used react-router-dom for the Routing throughout.

I used flexbox to individually style the page and components, and I revied color schemes using [Encycolorpedia](https://encycolorpedia.com/) - one of my favorite design and colorway resources.

I used prop drilling to send the info through components, however there is some commented code from starting to implement hooks instead.

## Future Development

Add/Remove Hotsauces
Hooks/Stateful components
DB connections and deployment
