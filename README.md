# GETTIN' SAUCY

## Purpose

The _best_ application around for learning and comparing hotsauce!

## How To

This app is not currently deployed and you will need to download the zip file or fork the repo to view on your localhost server.

You can view the repo on GitHub @ [malicemarie/hotsauce-exercise](https://github.com/malicemarie/hotsauce-exercise).

## Technologies Used

I used create-react-app to load the application.

I used react-router-dom for the Routing throughout.

I used flexbox to individually style the page and components, and I revied color schemes using [Encycolorpedia](https://encycolorpedia.com/) - one of my favorite design and colorway resources.

I used prop drilling to send the info through components, however there is some commented code from starting to implement hooks instead.

## Future Development

Add/Remove Hotsauces
Hooks/Stateful components
DB connections and deployment
